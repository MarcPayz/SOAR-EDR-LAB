# Network-Monitoring-Lab (In progress)

## Objective

The objective of this lab is to practice using a variety of network monitoring tools within a realistic enterprise environment, while also integrating different types of controls, including corrective, detective, and preventative measures.

### Tools Used

- Security Onion
- pfsense
- Suricata
- Nessus

## General Knowledge
Before I begin I will give a litle background on Security Onion, pfsense, Suricata, and Nessus.
<br> <br>
Security Onion is a free and open-source platform for monitoring and securing networks. It combines several tools to help detect and respond to security threats. Security Onion is capable of monitoring network traffic, detecting intrusions, managing logs, and allowing you to respond to security incidents. <br>

Pfsense is a versatile and powerful tool for managing network security and routing. I will be utilizing pfsense's firewwall capabilities for network segmentation and security. <br> 

Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning tool that helps identify and fix security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications. <br>

Suricata is an open-source network threat detection engine that provides real-time intrusion detection (IDS), intrusion prevention (IPS), and network monitoring. It is designed to inspect network traffic, detect suspicious activities, and respond to security threats.
